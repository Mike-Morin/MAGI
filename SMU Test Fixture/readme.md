## Source Measure Unit Test Fixture


- Characterize nanocolloidal and solid state neuromorphic devices
  - Measure impedance changes as a result of precise excitation charges and flux-linkages over a large and precise range of excitation input values.
  - Picocoulomb and picovolt-seconds targeted.
- Relay multiplexer to interface with up to 16 devices.
- Utilizes Analog Discovery 2 (AD2) for analog measurement and relay control.
  - Aux power and scope input (for pH meter in this project).
  - Provides isolated, clean power for AD2.
  - Exposes AD2 ports for pass-through (AD2 is still useful for other projects).
  - Selectable fully differential and single ended scope modes.
  - "Automatic" AD2 calibration with external multimeter.
  - Internal impedance analyzer shunt resistor selector.
 - External excitation and multimeter inputs.
