## 363_Electrode
Electrode array with 3 input neuron contacts, 6 hidden layer contacts, and 3 output neuron contacts with dual input and output contacts for excitatory and inhibitory input and output neurons. Fits on a standard compound microscope stage and supports 12mm round coverslips for the electrode arrays.

## PetriDish
A chemotaxis game to be interfaced with a physical neural network using the Analog Discovery 2 API. Intended to train a network using reinforcement learning. An agent must follow concentration gradients to food in order to replenish energy. You can play it too.

## pnn_cs_driver
A 4 channel precision voltage controlled current source. 1mA/V, biploar 5mA+/-20nA output with 18V compliance voltage, <10ppm, 3.5 MHz bandwdith.

## SMU Test Fixture (In Progress)
16-Channel source measure unit with multiplexer for the Analog Discovery 2 (AD2). Intended to interface with a 32 pin electrode array. 

## SMU Shunt Amp (In Progress)
 - Prototype board for high speed, precision SMU Test Fixture current shunt amp.
 
## 20 Pin Electrode Connector
Pogo pin connector to bare wire. For mounting to a microscope stage and making contact with a microscope slide electrode array. This PCB goes on the stage, slides clip under the pogo pins, and a very flexible wiring harness comes off this board and into your test gear. The idea is to save a lot of money on a probe station microscope combo.

## Electrode Castellated
Microscope slide electrode array utilizing castellations as electrodes. This electrode array provides two independent cavities for testing colloidal neuromorphic devices, or, potentially, real biological neurons (use biocompatible plating such as ENIG gold). This should be epoxied to a glass slide and can be sealed over top with ports for pumping in and out materials. The cutouts allow microscopy while performing electrical excitation and measurement.

Soak FR4 boards in semiconductor grade water for a day to remove contaminant ions if precision measurements are required.

## Precision Rail Splitter
Simple precision rail splitter, currently untested. I find myself needing one of these weirdly often for experiments. The SMU Test Fixture should mostly eliminate this need.
 
## MAGI Symbols, Footprints, Models
KiCad  symbols, footprints, and models.
